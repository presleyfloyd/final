         <p>When I was in second grade, I was diagnosed with dyslexia, and I quickly got the idea that reading books and loving them was completely out of the picture. So, until I was 14, I never tried. A year later, I fell in love with reading, but I kept it small. Then I met one of my best friends, and she convinced me to read the Sarah J. Maas universe. So, in December of 2023, I started my journey of reading a 16-book series. And now, with one book left, I can say reading is my favorite thing to do, and there is no book I wouldn’t try to read just because of the length. This year I have read 22 books, and three of them were more than 800 pages. Second-grade me would be so proud, and me now? I am so proud. </p>
