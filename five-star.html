    <h2>Throne of Glass by Sarah J. Maas</h2>
    <p>Pages: 432</p>
    <p>5 stars</p>
    <p>This book was amazing. I read it as the second book in the series just after The Assassin’s Blade. It leaves you with just enough to keep going. The way she gradually builds the 8-book world the reader is about to embark on is wonderful, and she does an amazing job planting seeds that will be very important later.</p>

    <h2>Crown of Midnight by Sarah J. Maas</h2>
    <p>Pages: 418</p>
    <p>Dates read: Mar 15th to 19th </p>
    <p>5 stars</p>
    <p> Nothing in this series will get a rank lower than 5. It is a work of art. That being said, probably my least favorite book, but it is still amazing. My only problem with it is that this book does a lot of world-building, and it can feel like a lot and very confusing. I’m impatient, so reading this was <storng>stressful</storng>.</p>
