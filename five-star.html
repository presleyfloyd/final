        <p>5 stars</p>
        <p>This book was amazing. I read it as the second book in the series just after The Assassin’s Blade. It leaves you with just enough to keep going. The way she gradually builds the 8-book world the reader is about to embark on is wonderful, and she does an amazing job planting seeds that will be very important later.</p>

        <p>Ranking: Five Stars</p>
        <p> Nothing in this series will get a rank lower than 5. It is a work of art. That being said, probably my least favorite book, but it is still amazing. My only problem with it is that this book does a lot of world-building, and it can feel like a lot and very confusing. I’m impatient, so reading this was <storng>stressful</storng>.</p>

        <p> This book was amazing and heartbreaking, and I loved it SOOO much. It was great historical fiction, and when someone asks me for an LGBTQIA+ rec, this is what I say. </p>

        <p>I know this took me a while, but I was finding it hard to give it a chance because Chaol is annoying.</p>
        <p>Spoilers!! Loved this book because of Yrene. She is just so badass, and the full-circle-ness of her story was amazing. Chaol and her are cute if you ignore the fact that Chaol (Kale, yes like the plant, that’s his name) has the real characteristics of a man and is not this fantasy feminist perfect man.</p>

        <p>I have no idea how I read this book so fast.</p>
        <p>Spoilers!! Poor fucking Aelin. This book was emotional torment. Dorian is an absolute diva icon…</p>
        <p>Here it is, the one thing I LOATHE about these books, it actually makes me angry: Aelin loses her powers. THIS MAKES ME SO MAD. HASN’T SHE BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH??? CAN A WOMAN HAVE IT ALL FOR ONCE??? LIKE SHE HAD NO CHOICE. FUCK THE GODS AHAHAHAHAHAHAH.</p>

        <p>Aug 14th to 23rd</p>
        <p>Ranking: Five Stars</p>
        <p>Really, I barely read the book, then read the whole thing on the 23rd. I was convinced there would be nothing as good as TOG, but I was wrong. Throne of Glass is already the best female-main-character fantasy series according to the fantasy community and of course her other two series come next, but this is up there. The world-building OMG. I did not think I would be this invested in anything ever again!</p>

        <p>Ranking: Five Stars</p>
        <p>She does it again. In the second book the world-building she has achieved in just two books is incredible. The way she made the reader attached to the characters in just two books… and the ending!!! Perfect!</p>

        <p>Ranking: Five Stars</p>
        <p>This is her least good series, still better than everything else, but 3rd of her three series. Nothing Sarah J. Maas does is wrong, and she is iconic. The plot twists are crazy.</p>

        <p>I love this book. It was heartbreaking also. Sarah said, “fuck it, I know I’m the best, I’m going to do whatever I want and they’ll love it,” and Sarah… we DO love it!</p>
