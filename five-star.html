                <p>This book was amazing. I read it as the second book in the series, just after The Assassin’s Blade. It leaves you with just enough to keep going. The way she gradually builds the 8-book world the reader is about to embark on is wonderful, and she does an amazing job planting seeds that will be very important later.</p>

                <p> Nothing in this series will get a rank lower than 5. It is a work of art. That being said, probably my least favorite book, but it is still amazing. My only problem with it is that this book does a lot of world-building, and it can feel like a lot and very confusing. I’m impatient, so reading this was <storng>stressful</storng>.</p>

                <p>I know this took me a while, but I was finding it hard to give it a chance because Chaol is annoying.Spoilers!!<span class="blurred"> Loved this book because of Yrene. She is just so badass, and the full-circle-ness of her story was amazing. Chaol and her are cute if you ignore the fact that Chaol (Kale, yes, like the plant, that’s his name) has the real characteristics of a man and is not this fantasy feminist perfect man. </span></p>

                <p>Really, I barely read the book, then read the whole thing on the 23rd. I was convinced there would be nothing as good as TOG, but I was wrong. Throne of Glass is already the best female main character fantasy series according to the fantasy community, and of course, her other two series come next, but this is up there. The world-building OMG. I did not think I would be this invested in anything ever again!</p>

                <p>She does it again. In the second book, the world-building she has achieved in just two books is incredible. The way she made the reader attached to the characters in just two books… and the ending!!! Perfect!</p>
